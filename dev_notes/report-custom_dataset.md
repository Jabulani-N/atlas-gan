# Takeaways and Observations - custom dataset

Though the code does seem to work on the custom imageset, I ran into a small problem:

![screenshot of full res is too large](./images/raw%20images%20cost%20too%20much%20at%20full%20res.PNG)

Some images were so large they nearly crashed my computer. This is minimal problem. Once I get access to my browser back, I can use a ewebsite known as "burme" to preprocess the images for me, so none use excessive memory for allocation.
