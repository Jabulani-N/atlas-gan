# To-do List

- [ ] unchecked content

- [X] checked content

# SETUP

- [x] find where I did the MNIST preprocessing before
* it's in supervised learning > object detection > [7-yolo.](https://github.com/Jabulani-N/atlas-machine_learning/blob/main/supervised_learning/object_detection/7-yolo.py)

- [ ] copy that preprocessor code into current project

- [ ] have AI write a check for making sure it is preprocessed correctly

# DCGAN

- [ ] impliment a baseline DCGAN
- [ ] Train that baseline DCGAN on MNIST

## Alter the DCGAN
- [ ] see if increaseing or decreasing hte number of layers improves things
- [ ] filter sizes
- [ ] strides
