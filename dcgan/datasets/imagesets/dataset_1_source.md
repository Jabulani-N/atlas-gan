This links to a dataset of labelled images (of characters from the series Touhou Project.)

I'll need to research how to use huggingface datasets.

- I only want to extract the images from the set this creates. I do not need labels.

when images have been extracted, I have the means to get an ndarray representation of each image, and to resize them in the preprocessor.

As soon as images have been extracted, it should be able to train as normal.
