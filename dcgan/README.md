Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network

## datasets

Datasets will be held within dedicated directory, categorized by type.

* this affords more transferability, as data categories can be addded and their names can be used to identify the type of data recieved, changing the GAN's behavior and formatting to suit the task at hand with minimal need to alter code.

  * this also allows created models to be automatically placed in the correct locations based on input type

## models

created model objects will be stored in this directory.
